**Problem Description**
The task at hand is to design and build a relational database for our tutoring company, Brightpath. Brightpath offers one-on-one tutoring services across multiple subjects, with tutors working in different locations to assist students in scheduled sessions. The session entity serves as the central entity of our data model, capturing essential details about which tutor is teaching, which student is receiving tutoring, the subject being covered, the session location, and its duration. Supporting entities include tutors, students, subjects, assignments, attendance, feedback, locations, and paymentsâ€”all interconnected to ensure seamless tracking of tutoring activities. Our goal is to build an accurate and functional database that allows us to generate sample data, populate entities with meaningful attributes, and run queries that provide valuable insights. These insights may include student progress tracking, session scheduling, and payment records to help optimize our tutoring services.
